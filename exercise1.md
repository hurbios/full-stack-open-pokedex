Lets consider an example case of web development with release time closing in. The dev team consists of 6 developers. The language the team has chosen for the task is Python. The team needs to setup CI/CD pipeline before the release to keep the main branch deployable and up to date with production.

The team could use one of GitHub (GH) Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI, AWS Codepipeline (& CodeDeploy & CodeBuild) etc. to achieve the task. The team is remote and based in different locations. The organization doesn't have servers or resources to host such themselves. The project is startup type and developing quite ordinary web app so there is no need for big servers right now but if all goes well this might scale quite a bit. Based on this information the team decides to use cloud-based environment instead of on-premise. The team has chosen a Cloud Service Provider that doesn't offer their own CI/CD tools like AWS does. The team is already using GH for version management so they decide to use GH Actions.

The team is new and the members have a bit different coding styles and they want to unify the style so they decide to use pylint for linting. They also want to decrease possibility for future changes breaking existing functionality so they decide to use unittest for unit testing. For dependency management and building they'll use poetry.
